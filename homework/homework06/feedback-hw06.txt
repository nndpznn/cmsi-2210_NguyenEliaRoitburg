Total possible points 100

========================================================

TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 97.00/100.00 which is 97% which is an A-plus

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD: assembles and links, runs and asks for input, then gets a
   floating point exception.

problem 2 gcdFinder & findGCDfunc: assembles and links, runs and asks for
   input, but then appears to go into an infinite loop.  Had to kiis it with
   "control+C".

problem 3 paritygen: assembles and links and runs, but gets a floating point
   exception.  OBTW, it's "parity", not "pairity", but I like yours better.

problem 4 whichEndIsUp: got a warning on compilation here of incompatible
   pointer types.  The types don't match between the cast pointer and your
   variable num.  Also, there needs to be NO spaces between the address
   and star operators and the tokens they go with.  I fixed that for you.
   Now it runs despite the warning.

problem 5 makeNBOC & makeNBOCtest: compiles, links and runs, even with the
   warning as before.  Hard to tell if it's actually swapping correctly, but
   instead of "5" I got "83886080" so call it good.

problem 6 makeNBON & makeNBOC: finally, compiles, assembles, links OK, but
   running gives a seg fault.  ACK!

========================================================
SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~  97.78% of  5 points =  4.89 points
   homework04 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework05 ~  95.00% of 10 points =  9.50 points
   homework06 ~  97.00% of 15 points = 14.55 points
                       semester total: 43.94 out of 45.00 = 97.64%
                             which is an A-plus

Good work on this and all the assignments! It's been a pleasure having all
three of you in class...  have an excellent break!
